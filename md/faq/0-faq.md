* #### I saw in the `README.md` that Kute is written in Kotlin, and meant for Kotlin <br> Can I use **Kute** `asString()` with <u>Java</u>?
  > Sure! All features of **Kute** `asString()` are available in Java as well<br>
  > * **Kute** `asString()` has various features aimed to make using it in Java as easy as it is in Kotlin
  >    * See [this documentation page with more about usage with Java ‚Üí]((#use-asstring-from-java-))
  > * Several tests and/or test objects of **Kute** are Java-code, to ensure that it interoperates smoothly with Java

* #### Does Kute `asString()` use annotation processing?
  > No

* #### I want to have Personally Identifiable Data masked in my log files.<br>Does **Kute** `asString()` have that option?
  > Yes!<br>
  > You should check out this documentation page: [Hide, replace, or obscure property values ‚Üí](../howto/hide-replace-obscure-property-values.md). 

* #### Is **Kute** `asString()` stable?
  > It should be!
  > 
  > **Kute** `asString()` is tested both with extensive unit tests, and with other applications.<br>
  > The unit tests contain all the kind of exotic stuff, both Kotlin and Java, I could came up with.
  > 
  > * Think of lambdas, both Kotlin and Java, both as instance variables and as local variables,<br>
  > SAM-wrappers, extension-methods, anonymous inner classes, method-local classes, property extensions, callables, functional interfaces, delegates, etc. etc. etc.
  > * The tests with other applications involve tests with Java 11 module system, JPA, and others.
  > 
  > **Kute** `asString()` is tested on Java versions from 11 to 21 <br>
  > So yes, **Kute** `asString()` should be stable.<br>
  > But as everyone knows, practice can always come up with new surprises.<br>
  > 
  > In any case, **Kute** `asString()` handles all `Exception`s, so it should not come in your way, anyway.
  >
  > Also note:
  > * **Kute** `asString()` has been tested on Java versions from 11 to 21, and on different OS's.

* #### OK, but is **Kute** `asString()`'s <u>API</u> stable?

  _**I like Kute `asString()` but I don't want to risk having to change my code base with every new version of **Kute**... `asString()`**_
  > Fair point. YES. This is important.
  > 
  > The API of **Kute** with regard to existing `public` classes, methods, properties etc. <u>MUST **NOT** change over successive versions</u>.<br>
  > This is a **_hard requirement_** for contributors who want to contribute to **Kute** `asString()`<br>
  > See the instructions [here](../howto/contribute/contribute.md).
  > 
  > Also note:
  > * **Kute** `asString()` has hundreds of tests, both Kotlin and Java, written over a span of some years.<br>
  >   During development of the initial version, when things did not feel logical anymore,<br>
  > the code (package structure) and API have been changed in order to make it more logical and intuitive.<br>
  > Also, over time, when the API didn't feel intuitive, this has been corrected during development.
  > It has been reviewed a few times too.

* #### Is Kute `asString()`'s output guaranteed to stay the same, over versions?
  > No.
  > * Newer versions of **Kute** `asString()` may cause variations in how properties are rendered
  > * Users may suggest improvements
  > * Bugs may need to be fixed
  > * Kotlin's reflection libraries may introduce new features
  > 
  > So you shouldn't take the current output for granted.<br>
  > That being said, changes in the output should be limited / minimal.
  >
  > Summarized: it would not be realistic to promise that it will stay the same forever.

* #### Are there plans to improve or extend Kute `asString()` with new features?
  > There are no concrete plans for new features, currently.<br>
  > There are some ideas (see [README.md ‚Üí](../../README.md)), but, for now, the main aim is to have it incorporated and used by projects, and learn from experiences.
  > 
  > **Kute** `asString()` is considered stable and robust, and it is already tested in different environments / frameworks / systems.<br>
  > Tests in a greater variety of environments are under development, e.g.:
  >  * Multi-module projects using Java 11 module system (JigSaw)
  >  * Multi-module OSGI projects
  >  * Database centered systems
  >  * System with enhanced security (SecurityManager)
  >  * ...
  > 
  > So **Kute** `asString()` in its current form is considered a feature-complete, stable, usable and robust library.<br>
  > It is reasonable to say that it is even more robust than some other widely used tools or libraries.<br>
  > The focus is now mainly on additional testing in a multitude of environments.
  > 
  > That being said, if users come with viable suggestions for new features,<br>
  > these will be considered seriously!

* #### Is **Kute** `asString()` open-source?
  > Yes, in accordance to [The Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd/) of the [Open Source Initiative¬Æ](https://opensource.org/osd/).
  > * It is under [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)-license.<br>
      The license statement can be found in the project root: see the **[LICENSE](../../LICENSE)**.

* #### Can I contribute to Kute `asString()`?
  > If you feel you could add some value to **Kute** `asString()`, see: [How to contribute to Kute `asString()` ‚Üí](../howto/contribute/contribute.md)<br><br>
  > E.g. by:
  > * reviewing
  > * improving code
  > * extending tests
  > * suggestions for features
 
* #### Does **Kute** `asString()` feature different output styles, like Apache's `toStringBuilder`?
  > No.
  > 
  > * Apache's `toStringBuilder` features different styles:<br>
  > `DEFAULT_STYLE`, `MULTI_LINE_STYLE`, `NO_FIELD_NAMES_STYLE`, `SHORT_PREFIX_STYLE`, `SIMPLE_STYLE`, `NO_CLASS_NAME_STYLE`, `JSON_STYLE`
  > * Besides that, there are different classes like `ToStringStyle`, `StandardToStringStyle` and `RecursiveToStringStyle`
  >    * With loads of options that you can tweak
  >    * And you can write your own style.
  >
  > An overload of options has never been the aim of **Kute** `asString()`<br>
  > **Kute** `asString()` has a different, practice-based approach.
  > * It opts for a single basic style, equivalent to Kotlin's `toString()` of data classes.
  > * **Kute** `asString()` does provide practice-based options to tweak the output.
  >    * Things like delimiters, settings at which length values should be truncated, etc.
  >    * Whether to include identity hashes, whether to include `companion` properties etc.
  >    * [Keeping <u>P</u>ersonally <u>I</u>dentifiable <u>D</u>ata away from prying eyes ‚Üí](../howto/hide-replace-obscure-property-values.md)
  >       * Think of GDPR-regulations
  > 
  > So **Kute** `asString()` focuses on practice-based options
  >  * Not: making everything possible for everyone.
  > 
  > Specifaclly: No `Json`-like output.
  > * `Json`-output suggests serialization; **Kute** `asString()` does not pretend to accomplish that.
  >    * For instance, **Kute** `asString()` truncates too verbose values and collections.<br>
  >        * Developers and admins usually are "_not interested_" in (i.e., _annoyed by_) endless strings of 1000+ chars in their log files
  >        * But you can't truncate do that if you pretend to produce `Json`.
  > * There are excellent other libraries for `Json`-izing
