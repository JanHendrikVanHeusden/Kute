* #### I saw in the `README.md` that Kute is written in Kotlin, and meant for Kotlin <br> Can I use **Kute** `asString()` with <u>Java</u>?
  > Sure! All features of **Kute** `asString()` are available in Java as well<br>
  > * **Kute** `asString()` has various features aimed to make using it in Java as easy as it is in Kotlin
  >    * See [the documentation with more about usage in Java ‚Üí]((#use-asstring-from-java-))
  > * Several tests and/or test objects of **Kute** are Java-code, to ensure that it interoperates smoothly with Java

* #### Does Kute `asString()` use annotation processing?
  > No

* #### Is **Kute** `asString()` stable?
  > It should be!
  > 
  > **Kute** `asString()` is tested both with extensive unit tests, and with other applications.<br>
  > The unit tests contain all the kind of exotic stuff, both Kotlin and Java, I could came up with.
  > 
  > * Think of lambdas, both Kotlin and Java, both as instance variables and as local variables,<br>
  > SAM-wrappers, extension-methods, anonymous inner classes, method-local classes, property extensions, callables, functional interfaces, delegates, etc. etc. etc.
  > * The tests with other applications involve tests with Java 11 module system, JPA, and others.
  > 
  > **Kute** `asString()` is tested on Java versions from 11 to 21 <br>
  > So yes, **Kute** `asString()` should be stable.<br>
  > But as everyone knows, practice can always come up with new surprises.<br>
  > 
  > In any case, **Kute** `asString()` handles all `Exception`s, so it should not come in your way, anyway.

* #### OK, but is **Kute** `asString()`'s <u>API</u> stable?

  _**I like Kute `asString()` but I don't want to risk having to change my code base with every new version of **Kute**... `asString()`**_
  > Fair point. YES. This is important.
  > 
  > The API of **Kute** with regard to existing `public` classes, methods, properties etc. <u>MUST **NOT** change over successive versions</u>.<br>
  > This is a **_hard requirement_** for contributors who want to contribute to **Kute** `asString()`<br>
  > See the instructions [here](../howto/contribute/contribute.md).
  > 
  > Also note:
  > * **Kute** `asString()` is tested on Java versions from 11 to 21, and on different OS's.
  > * **Kute** `asString()` has hundreds of tests, both Kotlin and Java, written over a span of some years.<br>
  >   During development of the initial version, when things did not feel logical or intuitive anymore,<br>
  > the code (package structure) has been reorganised to correct that.<br>
  > It has been reviewed a few times too, to make sure it was logical to others too.

* #### Is Kute `asString()`'s output guaranteed to stay the same, over versions?
  > No.
  > * Newer versions of **Kute** `asString()` may cause variations in how properties are rendered
  > * Users may suggest improvements
  > * Bugs may need to be fixed
  > * Kotlin's reflection libraries may introduce new features
  > 
  > So you shouldn't take the current output for granted.<br>
  > That being said, changes in the output should be limited / minimal.
  >
  > Summarized: it would not be realistic to promise that it will stay the same forever.

* #### Are there plans to improve or extend Kute `asString()` with new features?
> There are no concrete plans for new features, currently.<br>
> There are some ideas, but for now, the main aim is to have it incorporated and used by projects, and learn from experiences.
> 
> **Kute** `asString()` is considered stable and robust, and it is already tested in different environments / frameworks / systems.<br>
> Tests in a greater variety of environments are under development, e.g.:
>  * Multi-module projects using Java 11 module system (JigSaw)
>  * Multi-module OSGI projects
>  * Database centered systems
>  * System with enhanced security (SecurityManager)
>  * ...
> 
> So **Kute** `asString()` in its current form is considered a feature-complete, stable, usable and robust library.<br>
> It is reasonable to say that it is even more robust than some other widely used tools or libraries.<br>
> The focus is now mainly on additional testing in a multitude of environments.
> 
> That being said, if users come with viable suggestions for new features,<br>
> these will be considered seriously!

* #### Is **Kute** `asString()` open-source?
  > Yes, in accordance to [The Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd/) of the [Open Source Initiative¬Æ](https://opensource.org/osd/).
  > * It is under [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)-license.<br>
