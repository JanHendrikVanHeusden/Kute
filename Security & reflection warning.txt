Warning

This utility (Apache Commons lang ReflectionToStringBuilder) uses the class AccessibleObject in the J2SE reflection package
to bypass access modifiers and access private member variables of an object directly.

If your system is running under a restrictive SecurityManager, you may need to alter your configuration
to allow Commons Lang to bypass these security restrictions.
Only use this reflection builder if you are certain that your code will run in an environment without a restrictive security policy.
I use this utility in a system that runs on a few servers in a known location, but if I were writing a reusable library, a reflection builder would not be feasible;
if someone were to use my library in an environment with a different security policy, calling a toString() may cause problems.

The relevant permission is the suppressAccessChecks permission target of the java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission class.
