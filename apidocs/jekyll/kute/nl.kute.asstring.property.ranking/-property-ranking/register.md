# register



[jvm]\
override fun [register](register.html)()



Register this concrete [PropertyRankable](../-property-rankable/index.html) class to allow using it for ordering properties in [nl.kute.asstring.core.asString](../../nl.kute.asstring.core/as-string.html) output.



This method is called automatically when the class (or a subclass) is constructed; so there is no need to call it explicitly.
